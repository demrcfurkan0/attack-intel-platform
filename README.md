#  Attack Intel Platform - AI-Powered Cyber Attack Simulation & Response

The **Attack Intel Platform** is a full-stack, AI-driven web application that simulates modern Security Operations (SecOps). This platform allows analysts to launch common cyber-attacks in a controlled environment, detect these attacks using an AI model, and practice incident response workflows.

This project aims to provide a hands-on experience in attack detection, analysis, and response by mimicking the daily workflow of a SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst.

## Key Features

### Attack Simulation

Users can launch four different types of cyber-attack simulations:

- **DDoS (HTTP Flood):** Sends a high volume of HTTP requests to a target URL.
- **Brute Force:** Attempts various username and password combinations.
- **SQL Injection:** Injects malicious SQL queries into application inputs.
- **SYN Flood (Network Layer):** Sends numerous SYN packets to a target IP to exhaust network resources.

### AI-Based Detection

- Real-time analysis using a pre-trained **XGBoost** machine learning model.
- The model classifies traffic as either `BENIGN` or a specific **attack type**.

### Real-Time Interface

- **WebSocket** integration for live updates.
- Detected attacks appear instantly in the **Alerts** tab.

### Incident Response Center

- **Triage & Analysis**: Each alert can be investigated in the **Response Center**.
- **Analyst Notes**: Add notes, mark false positives, and apply tags like `critical` or `under investigation`.
- **Dynamic Playbooks**: Each attack type has a guided checklist for mitigation steps.

### AI Co-Pilot

- Ask natural language questions using **Google Gemini API**.
- Get summaries, response suggestions, or incident analysis.

### Dashboard & Reporting

- Charts visualizing:
  - Attack trends
  - Detection rates
  - Model accuracy (Confusion Matrix)
- Historical log of simulations and detections.

### User Management

- **JWT-based** authentication system.
- Role-based access control for analysts and admins.
